This is a MIPS Assembly program which will take in an input of scores and use Selection Sort to sort them in descending order. It will then take an input for a number of lowest scores to drop, and then output the average of the scores which were not dropped.
This was created not to be an extremely impressive technical feat, but as a test of competentcy in MIPS when compared to higher-level languages.
Created over the course of a single day(with test cases written and some minor optimization done the day after) with assistance from Christian Luchetta.
